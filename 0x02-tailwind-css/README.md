2. Right-click on an HTML file
3. Select "Open with Live Server"

## 📱 Testing Responsiveness

- **Desktop**: Full grid and flexbox layouts with proper spacing
- **Tablet**: Adjusted layouts with responsive breakpoints
- **Mobile**: Stacked layouts for optimal mobile viewing

To test responsiveness:
1. Open the HTML files in your browser
2. Use browser developer tools (F12)
3. Toggle device toolbar or manually resize the browser window
4. Test different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)

## 🎨 Design Features

- **Color Schemes**: Blue, red, green, yellow, and gray color palettes
- **Typography**: Responsive text sizing with proper hierarchy
- **Spacing**: Consistent padding and margins using Tailwind utilities
- **Hover Effects**: Interactive navigation elements
- **Responsive Images**: Properly sized and positioned gallery images

## 🔧 Build Process

If you want to rebuild the CSS:

```bash
# Install Tailwind CSS (if not already installed)
npm install -D tailwindcss

# Build the CSS
npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./src/output.css

# Watch for changes (development)
npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./src/output.css --watch
```

## 📖 Key Tailwind Concepts Covered

- **Grid System**: `grid`, `grid-cols-*`, `gap-*`
- **Flexbox**: `flex`, `justify-*`, `items-*`, `space-*`
- **Responsive Design**: `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:` prefixes
- **Colors**: Background colors, text colors, and hover states
- **Spacing**: Padding (`p-*`), margins (`m-*`), and gaps
- **Typography**: Font sizes, weights, and line heights
- **Layout**: Width utilities, positioning, and display properties

## 🌟 Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **Mobile-First Design**: Layouts are designed for mobile first, then enhanced for larger screens
2. **Semantic HTML**: Proper use of HTML5 semantic elements
3. **Accessibility**: Proper heading hierarchy and alt text for images
4. **Performance**: Efficient use of Tailwind utilities and CDN when appropriate
5. **Maintainability**: Clean, readable code with consistent naming conventions

## 📝 Additional Notes

- Some files use local CSS (`src/output.css`) while others use Tailwind CDN
- Media queries are included for additional responsive behavior
- Placeholder images are used for the gallery demonstration
- All layouts are cross-browser compatible
